# U2F Embedded

This code implements the U2F protocol as per the 
[raw message specification](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-v1.0-nfc-bt-amendment-20150514/fido-u2f-raw-message-formats.html).

It does not include functionality for HID or NFC as that
is device specific.

This is designed to work on any device with a focus on embedded applications.

*This is a work in progress*
